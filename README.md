# Package for Drupal Code Quality presets

This has been customised from [vijaycs85/drupal-quality-checker](https://packagist.org/packages/vijaycs85/drupal-quality-checker) for Axelerant needs. Apart from a different template file, it uses the Axelerant logo.

## Installation

First, run `composer require` to include the package in your application.

```bash
composer require --dev axelerant/drupal-quality-checker
```

Then, copy the `grumphp.yml.dist` from the library to your project root.

```bash
cp vendor/axelerant/drupal-quality-checker/grumphp.yml.dist grumphp.yml
```

There is also a phpmd.xml.dist you may copy and edit if you wish (don't forget to change the grumphp.yml in your project as well).

## Usage

No additional steps required, but if git hooks aren't fired, run `php ./vendor/bin/grumphp git:init`. For additional commands, look at [grumhp's documentation](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp/blob/master/doc/commands.md).

## Customising

Almost all customising begins with first copying the `grumphp.yml.dist` file to your project. Make sure you have the file.

### Disable commit banners

GrumPHP supports banners to celebrate (or scold) on your commit. This is fun but it is possible it gets on your nerves. If you donâ€™t want it, edit the grumphp.yml file and replace the following parameters:

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
parameters:
    ascii: ~
```

You could even disable specific ones like this:

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
parameters:
    ascii:
        succeeded: ~
```

### Overwrite phpmd ruleset

Copy the ruleset to the project root first

```bash
cp vendor/axelerant/drupal-quality-checker/phpmd.xml.dist phpmd.xml
```

Edit it as per your needs and commit. Remember to modify the grumphp.yml file with the new path.

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
parameters:
  tasks:
    phpmd:
      ruleset: ['phpmd.xml']
```

### Customise phpcs rules

Copy the ruleset to the project root first

```bash
cp vendor/axelerant/drupal-quality-checker/phpcs.xml.dist phpcs.xml
```

Edit it as per your needs and commit. Remember to modify the grumphp.yml file with the new path.

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
parameters:
  tasks:
    phpcs:
      standard: ['phpcs.xml']
```
